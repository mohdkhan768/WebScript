I used content from a lot of mmy lectures from Webscript programming, maority of what i coded was
from there, but some basic learning was also done through the use of the links provided by the prof
such as https://www.w3schools.com/html/ and CSS on the same website helped me alot, it provided explanantion
and alternatives of the learning code. The code was fully written by me and none was taken from any other sources except
the ones i learned from the lectures, tutorial, and the website i used for learning.
